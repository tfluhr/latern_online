## Instructions for the Online Workflow

- Upload word processing document files (files with the `.docx` or `.odt` extension) to this folder
- Create a commit to finish saving these files to the repository
- GitHub will run a Lantern script to convert these files to Markdown (i.e. files with the `.md` extension)
- The converted files will be added to the `chapters/` folder

The conversions might not be perfect. Once the converted files are in the `chapters/` folder, you can open them in the GitHub text editor to correct any formatting errors.

## Instructions for the Desktop Workflow

- Add word processing document files (files with the `.docx` or `.odt` extension) to this folder
- Run `make markdown` in your terminal
- Lantern will convert these files to Markdown (i.e. files with the `.md` extension)
- The converted files will be added to the `chapters/` folder

The conversions between `.docx` to `.md` might not be perfect. Once the converted files are in the `chapters/` folder, you can open them in your text editor to correct any typesetting errors.
