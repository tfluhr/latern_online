# Introduction

::: box :::

"[Minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/)" is a critical framework that places limits on hardware and software choices in order to prioritize the longevity of digital texts, the mitigation of technological obscolescence, and the maintenance of systems. Lantern applies this framework to the production of open textbooks.

Lantern uses Markdown as a typesetting format for publishing. 

> "Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions." - [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy) (one of Markdown's original creators)

Lantern uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) as it's processing engine to produce publication formats, such as HTML, PDF, DOCX, and EPUB. Lantern can be used with or without installing additional software on your computer. 

## Features

- **Free:** Lantern uses open source software and free-of-charge web services for processing, building, deploying, and hosting open textbooks. 

- **Portable:** Lantern emphasizes the use of plain text file formats that can run on any machine or web host. No databases or servers are required. 

- **Multi-format:** Lantern teaches semantic markup technologies for producing Markdown, HTML, PDF, DOCX, and LaTeX editions of open textbooks. 

- **Sustainable:** Lantern minimizes the infrastructure, configuration, hosting, and maintenance costs related to traditional digital publishing systems and platforms.

> Plain text files have many advantages over other formats. For one, they are readable on virtually all devices. They have also withstood the test of time better than other file types – if you’ve ever tried to open a document saved in a legacy word processor format, you’ll be familiar with the compatibility challenges involved.

**What does Lantern mean?**

Lantern is the nickname for the atrium entrance to the Main Library at Northwestern, which resembles a giant lantern. It's a rounded tower of windows that opens to the most heavily used study area in the building. In our case, the name represents a starting point for a new way of open textbook production.

## Who is Lantern for?

Lantern was developed as a minimal computing toolkit for the open education community. We are librarians who provide publishing services to faculty OER authors. We recognize that OER publishing programs are expensive to operate and sustain, so we developed Lantern to help minimize the digital production, hosting, and maintenance costs of multi-format textbook publishing by using open source software, free web services, and [static web technologies](https://lib-static.github.io/). 

## Credits

Lantern is a project by Chris Diaz (Digital Publishing Librarian) and Lauren McKeen McDonald (Open Education Librarian) of Northwestern University with support from the [Association of Research Libraries](https://www.arl.org/). Lantern is based on [Pandoc Book Template](https://github.com/wikiti/pandoc-book-template), and was inspired by numerous publishing tools, including [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/), [Quire](https://quire.netlify.app/), [Course-in-a-Box](https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org/), [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/), and [Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/).
