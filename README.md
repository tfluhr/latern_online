# Lantern

## Description

This repository contains Lantern, an [OER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources) publishing template for [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) that produces textbooks in multiple formats. 

- Example: https://nulib-oer.github.io/lantern/
- Documentation: http://lantern.northwestern.pub/

## Purpose

Lantern was developed as an experiment to create a [minimal computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/) approach to OER publishing, starting with open textbooks. Minimal computing refer to "computing done under some set of significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, power, or other factors." With this framework in mind, we designed Lantern as a free and sustainable option for digital publishing.
